# Implemented Articles Methods 

There are three methods that were applied for spikelets detection task also used for comparision its metrics and tech features before developing my own

## Methods

- "Boosted-Unet + MSE" based on paper by M.P.Pound et al ["Deep Learning for Multi-task Plant Phenotyping"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/papers/w29/Pound_Deep_Learning_for_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)

- "Unet + WHD" based on paper by J.Ribera et al ["Locating Objects Without Bounding Boxes"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07564.pdf)

- "YOLO v.8" based on paper by J.Redmon et al ["You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640v5.pdf)

First and second method were implemented by [@rostepifanov](https://github.com/rostepifanov), however i fixed algorithm of counting metrics by normalise distances

Last method is open-source code by [@ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics)
